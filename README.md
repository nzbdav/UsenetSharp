# UsenetSharp

UsenetSharp is a .NET 9 library for asynchronous, read-only NNTP access and
streaming yEnc decoding.

## Features

- Asynchronous NNTP connection, authentication, STAT, HEAD, BODY, ARTICLE, and DATE commands
- TLS with platform certificate validation
- Incremental, allocation-conscious yEnc decoding through RapidYencSharp
- Read-only, non-seekable response streams with cancellation support
- Serialized commands per connection; use multiple clients for parallel downloads

## Installation

Packages are currently published to GitHub Packages, not nuget.org. GitHub's
NuGet registry requires authentication, including for public packages. Create a
personal access token with `read:packages`, then add the repository owner as a
package source:

```bash
dotnet nuget add source \
  "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/hoivikaj/index.json" \
  --name github \
  --username YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME \
  --password "$GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN" \
  --store-password-in-clear-text

dotnet add package UsenetSharp --source github
```

Avoid putting a token directly in a checked-in `NuGet.config`. See GitHub's
[NuGet registry documentation](https://docs.github.com/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-nuget-registry)
for credential-storage options.

## Usage

### Connect and authenticate

```csharp
using UsenetSharp.Clients;

using var client = new UsenetClient();

await client.ConnectAsync(
    "news.example.com",
    port: 563,
    useSsl: true,
    cancellationToken);

var authentication = await client.AuthenticateAsync(
    "username",
    "password",
    cancellationToken);

if (!authentication.Success)
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException(authentication.ResponseMessage);
}
```

TLS uses the platform's normal certificate validation. Credentials sent with
`useSsl: false` travel in plaintext; only use an unencrypted connection on a
network you trust.

### Retrieve an article body

`SegmentId` accepts a message ID with or without angle brackets:

```csharp
using UsenetSharp.Models;

SegmentId segmentId = "article-id@example.com";
var response = await client.BodyAsync(segmentId, cancellationToken);

if (!response.Success || response.Stream is null)
{
    Console.WriteLine(response.ResponseMessage);
    return;
}

await using var body = response.Stream;
await body.CopyToAsync(destination, cancellationToken);
```

`ARTICLE` also exposes parsed headers:

```csharp
var response = await client.ArticleAsync(segmentId, cancellationToken);

if (response.ArticleHeaders is not null)
{
    Console.WriteLine(response.ArticleHeaders.Subject);
}

if (response.Stream is not null)
{
    await using var article = response.Stream;
    await article.CopyToAsync(destination, cancellationToken);
}
```

### Check article availability

```csharp
var response = await client.StatAsync(segmentId, cancellationToken);

if (response.ArticleExists)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Article is available ({response.ResponseCode}).");
}
```

Calling `BODY` or `ARTICLE` directly is usually preferable to issuing a separate
`STAT` request first.

### Decode yEnc content

`YencStream` owns and disposes the body stream passed to it by default. Pass
`leaveOpen: true` when the caller must retain ownership:

```csharp
using UsenetSharp.Streams;

var response = await client.BodyAsync(segmentId, cancellationToken);
if (response.Stream is null)
{
    return;
}

await using var yenc = new YencStream(response.Stream);
var header = await yenc.GetYencHeadersAsync(cancellationToken);

if (header is not null)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{header.FileName}: {header.FileSize} bytes");
}

await yenc.CopyToAsync(destination, cancellationToken);
```

### Connection and stream lifecycle

One `UsenetClient` owns one TCP/TLS connection. Commands on that connection are
serialized. After a successful `BODY` or `ARTICLE`, the connection remains
reserved until the NNTP body terminator is consumed or the transfer fails.
Dispose response streams promptly, and call `WaitForReadyAsync` when you need to
know that the connection can accept another command. Use a separate client per
parallel download.

The body streams are readable but not writable or seekable. Dispose the client
after all active response streams have finished.

## Requirements

- .NET 9 SDK to build the repository
- .NET 9 runtime to consume the current package
- RapidYencSharp includes native binaries for Windows x64, Linux x64, and Linux
  ARM64. Other platforms, including macOS, must build `rapidyenc` and place its
  native library beside the application before using `YencStream`.

## Development and testing

Deterministic tests use local scripted NNTP servers and need no network access
or credentials:

```bash
dotnet restore --locked-mode
dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build --filter "TestCategory!=Integration"
dotnet pack UsenetSharp/UsenetSharp.csproj --configuration Release --no-build
```

Live-server tests are marked `Integration` and are excluded from CI. Set
`USENETSHARP_TEST_HOST`, `USENETSHARP_TEST_USERNAME`, and
`USENETSHARP_TEST_PASSWORD` to run them locally; never commit credentials.
